Todos

- packages list seems not to account for what is and isn't staged
- -e deps (with [extra,extra2]) do not show up in setup.py
- no unnecessary commit of __init__
- Enhance: Support any pip version, require pip-tools>=1.7
- Fix: plumbum.path.utils.copy: permission denied error

  Replaced with unix cp. May be a plumbum bug, was copying a directory
  whose permissions and containing files' permissions were rwx for all.

- Change: do not pypandoc convert README.rst
- Change: No longer require or format download_url
- Doc: comments
- todo first a bit more coding

  Fix: copy pre_commit_no_ignore files in release test

  Otherwise tests on release may file.
- disable pre-commit hook (don't commit this)

pip uninstall chicken-turtle-project
pip install .
